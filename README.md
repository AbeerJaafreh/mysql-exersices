"A foreign key constraint is not required merely to join two tables. For storage engines other than InnoDB, it is possible when defining a column to use a REFERENCES tbl_name(col_name) clause, which has no actual effect, and serves only as a memo or comment to you that the column which you are currently defining is intended to refer to a column in another table." - Reference dev.mysql.com

Assume that the structure of two tables departments and jobs.

| Field           | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra |

17. Write a SQL statement to create a table employees including columns employee_id, first_name, last_name, job_id, salary and make sure that, the employee_id column does not contain any duplicate value at the time of insertion, and the foreign key column job_id, referenced by the column job_id of jobs table, can contain only those values which are exists in the jobs table. The InnoDB Engine have been used to create the tables. The specialty of the statement is that, The ON UPDATE CASCADE action allows you to perform cross-table update and ON DELETE RESTRICT action reject the deletion. The default action is ON DELETE RESTRICT.

Assume that the structure of the table jobs and InnoDB Engine have been used to create the table jobs.

```CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS jobs ( 
JOB_ID integer NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY, 
JOB_TITLE varchar(35) NOT NULL DEFAULT ' ', 
MIN_SALARY decimal(6,0) DEFAULT 8000,

18. Write a SQL statement to create a table employees including columns employee_id, first_name, last_name, job_id, salary and make sure that, the employee_id column does not contain any duplicate value at the time of insertion, and the foreign key column job_id, referenced by the column job_id of jobs table, can contain only those values which are exists in the jobs table. The InnoDB Engine have been used to create the tables. The specialty of the statement is that, The ON DELETE CASCADE that lets you allow to delete records in the employees(child) table that refer to a record in the jobs(parent) table when the record in the parent table is deleted and the ON UPDATE RESTRICT actions reject any updates.

Assume that the structure of the table jobs and InnoDB Engine have been used to create the table jobs.

```CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS jobs ( 
JOB_ID integer NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY,

19. Write a SQL statement to create a table employees including columns employee_id, first_name, last_name, job_id, salary and make sure that, the employee_id column does not contain any duplicate value at the time of insertion, and the foreign key column job_id, referenced by the column job_id of jobs table, can contain only those values which are exists in the jobs table. The InnoDB Engine have been used to create the tables. The specialty of the statement is that, The ON DELETE SET NULL action will set the foreign key column values in the child table(employees) to NULL when the record in the parent table(jobs) is deleted, with a condition that the foreign key column in the child table must accept NULL values and the ON UPDATE SET NULL action resets the values in the rows in the child table(employees) to NULL values when the rows in the parent table(jobs) are updated.

Assume that the structure of two table jobs and InnoDB Engine have been used to create the table jobs.

```CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS jobs ( 
JOB_ID integer NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY, 
JOB_TITLE varchar(35) NOT NULL DEFAULT ' ', 
MIN_SALARY decimal(6,0) DEFAULT 8000,

| MAX_SALARY | decimal(6,0) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |

20. Write a SQL statement to create a table employees including columns employee_id, first_name, last_name, job_id, salary and make sure that, the employee_id column does not contain any duplicate value at the time of insertion, and the foreign key column job_id, referenced by the column job_id of jobs table, can contain only those values which are exists in the jobs table. The InnoDB Engine have been used to create the tables. The specialty of the statement is that, The ON DELETE NO ACTION and the ON UPDATE NO ACTION actions will reject the deletion and any updates.

Assume that the structure of two table jobs and InnoDB Engine have been used to create the table jobs.

```CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS jobs ( 
JOB_ID integer NOT NULL UNIQUE PRIMARY KEY, 
JOB_TITLE varchar(35) NOT NULL DEFAULT ' ',
